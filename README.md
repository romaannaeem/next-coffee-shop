# Next Coffee Shop

This project was built with Next.js. This is a simple e-commerce store with a 3 products and a stripe integration.

## Installation

If you would like to use this for yourself, please note that you'll need to create a `keys.js` file in the root directory after cloning/forking the repo. This file should have the following format:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_TEST_KEY: '...',
};
```

Replace the ... with your own stripe public key and it'll work. Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`, and it should work for you!
